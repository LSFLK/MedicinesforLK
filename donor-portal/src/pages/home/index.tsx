          <h3>An Acute Medical Emergency</h3>
          <p>
            Sri Lanka lacks a coordinated response to address the overall
            medical needs of hospitals. Given the limited resources it is
            essential to optimize the demand and distribution of supplies to
            help avoid possible duplication, address gaps and avoid detrimental
            outcomes to citizens most in need.
          </p>
          <h3>An Alternative Approach</h3>
          <p>
            ELIXIR is a platform designed to meet this need. It is operated by
            the Sri Lanka Red Cross along with a network of volunteers and
            professionals to help improve the efficacy of donations. In
            partnership with the Sri Lanka Medical Supplies Division we have
            compiled aid packages that aggregate needs across multiple hospitals
            to help achieve bulk price discounts from suppliers. Our volunteers
            help negotiate prices and coordinate invoicing and shipping
            logistics. ELIXIR facilitates transparency and accountability
            throughout the entire supply chain.
