          <p>
            The Elixir team is motivated by the singular goal of alleviating the
            medical crisis in Sri Lanka. We are accountable internally, to one
            another and our partner organizations and to a multitude of
            volunteers who have invested considerable time and effort to create
            Elixir. We are also accountable to you, our donors, both individuals
            and organizations alike in executing our fiduciary responsibility to
            maximize the utility of your donations.

          <h2>Transparency</h2>
          <p>
            Elixirâ€™s primary design goal is transparency. While the Sri Lanka
            Red Cross will monitor the flow of aid packages and provide daily
            status updates, we have also contracted the services of KPMG Sri
            Lanka, to perform an end-to-end audit of the Elixir process and
            finances. Our financial team will also publish the monthly statement
            of accounts on the Elixir website. We are committed to continuously
            improving our processes. Please contact us at elixir@redcross.lk
            should you have any questions or have for feedback for us.
