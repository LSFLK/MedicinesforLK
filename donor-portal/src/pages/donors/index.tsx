          We have a unique approach to receiving donations that is geared to
          help maximize transparency and accountability. Each aid package has a
          target donation goal that must be reached before being submitted as a
          purchase order to our suppliers. The Elixir platform tracks the aid
          package throughout its lifecycle and provides status at each stage of
          invoicing, shipping and delivery.

              We have a 2-step process that allows you to first pledge your
              support to a specific aid package and then arrange for payment
              once the target threshold is reached. Please email us at:
              <a href="mailto:elixir@slredcross.lk">elixir@slredcross.lk</a> so
              that we can create your Elixir account.
